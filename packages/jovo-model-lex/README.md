## Introduction

[Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) is a service by AWS that offers both automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU). We summarize this as a spoken language understanding (SLU) service. [You can learn more about the Jovo Framework Lex integration here](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-slu-lex).

Lex language models are similar to [Alexa Interaction Models](./amazon-alexa.md). Learn more in the [official Lex docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/what-is.html). The Jovo Model can be translated into this structure by using the npm package ([see below](#using-the-lex-jovo-model-npm-package)).


## Using the Lex Jovo Model npm Package

Install the package like this:
